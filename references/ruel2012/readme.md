abstract = {Abstract This paper presents results from the first two Space Shuttle test flights of the TriDAR vision system. TriDAR was developed as a proximity operations sensor for autonomous rendezvous and docking (AR\&D) missions to noncooperative targets in space. The system does not require the use of cooperative markers, such as retro-reflectors, on the target spacecraft. TriDAR includes a hybrid three-dimensional (3D) sensor along with embedded model based tracking algorithms to provide six-degree-of-freedom (6 DOF) relative pose information in real time. A thermal imager is also included to provide range and bearing information for far-range rendezvous operations. In partnership with the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and NASA, Neptec has space-qualified the TriDAR vision system and integrated it on board Space Shuttle Discovery to fly as a detailed test objective (DTO) on the STS-128 and STS-131 missions to the International Space Station (ISS). The objective of the TriDAR DTO missions was to demonstrate the system's ability to perform acquisition and tracking of a known target in space autonomously and provide real-time relative navigation cues. Knowledge (reference 3D model) about the target can be obtained on the ground or in orbit. Autonomous operations involved automatic acquisition of the ISS and real-time tracking, as well as detection and recovery from system malfunctions and/or loss of tracking. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},,
